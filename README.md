# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to practice my skills with JavaScript and apply it to create a functional coding quiz.
I built this project to combine all of the knowledge I have gained thus far with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a quiz that I will face in the real world of coding interviews.
This solved the problem of creating a quiz that others can take to test their knowledge of code.
I learned that Javascript is a combination of more than just the knowledge I have learned about coding thus far, but a lot of trial and error and independent research.


## Usage

   -Add screenshot of quiz.
   -Add link to deployed application.
